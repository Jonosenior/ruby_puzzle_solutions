# Puzzle Solutions

This is a collection of basic Ruby programming challenges, including a stock picker, a substring finder, and an array reader.

It's a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/building-blocks).


## Contents 

### Stock Picker

Goal: Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.

### Stock Picker

Goal: Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.
